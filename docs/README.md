# Musher Brand Documentation

This directory contains operational brand documentation for the Musher platform.

## What's Here

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| [activation-checklist.md](activation-checklist.md) | 4-week rollout roadmap for brand activation |
| [audit-guide.md](audit-guide.md) | Process for auditing content against brand guidelines |

## What Lives Elsewhere

The full brand kernel (manifesto, personas, voice, positioning) remains in the main Musher monorepo under `/brand/`. This standalone repo focuses on:

- **Design tokens** (`tokens/`) - Visual design system
- **Visual assets** (`src/`, `dist/`) - Logos, icons, social media assets
- **Operational docs** (`docs/`) - Checklists and guides for brand work
