# Musher Brand Documentation

This directory contains brand strategy and operational documentation for the Musher platform.

## What's Here

| Document | Purpose | Relationship |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| [brand-packet.md](brand-packet.md) | Strategic reference: positioning, voice, audience, trust signals, visual system (11 fields) | **The source of truth** for what to say, how to say it, and who to say it to |
| [Brand_Guidelines.md](Brand_Guidelines.md) | Visual/asset reference: logos, colors, assets, usage rules | **The source of truth** for how things look and where to find assets |
| [audit-guide.md](audit-guide.md) | Process for auditing content against brand guidelines | References banned vocabulary from `brand-packet.md` |
| [activation-checklist.md](activation-checklist.md) | 4-week rollout roadmap for brand activation | Sequenced plan for applying the brand |

### Brand Packet vs. Brand Guidelines

These two documents are complementary:

- **Brand Packet** answers: *Who are we talking to? What do we say? How do we say it? What do we never say? What trust signals do we have? What visual tokens do we use?*
- **Brand Guidelines** answers: *What do our logos look like? Where are the asset files? What color combinations work? What are the spacing rules for logos?*

The Brand Packet governs **strategy and copy**. The Brand Guidelines govern **visual assets and usage rules**. Both reference the same design tokens in `tokens/`.

## What Lives Elsewhere

- **Design tokens** (`tokens/`) — Visual design system (W3C DTCG format, Oklch colors)
- **Visual assets** (`src/`, `dist/`) — Logos, icons, social media assets
